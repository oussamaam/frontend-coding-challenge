# TrendingRepositories
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.5.

## Idea of the App 
This is a small webapp built with Angular that interacts with an actual sorted JSON data directly 
from the Github API. This app will demonstrate many features including listing the most starred Github repos 
that were created in the last 30 days one repository per row, showing details for each repo ( repository name, 
description, number of stars for the repo, number of issues for the repo, username and avatar of the owner ) ,
and pagination.

```bash
# clone the repo

cd frontend-coding-challenge/trending-repositories
